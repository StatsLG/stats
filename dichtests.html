    <h1>Dichotomous Tests</h1>
    <p>A dichotomous test is a test with only two possible results. Typically, these results are refered to as "positive" and "negative."
        A positive result means the test determined whatever it was testing for was true or present.  Common examples include roadside sobriety tests, home pregnancy tests, and cancer screenings.</p>
    <p>The importance of these tests extends to hypothesis testing in inferential statistics.</p>
    <h2>False Positive Rate (FPR)</h2>
    <p>The probability of a test concluding positive given the actual condition is negative.</p>
    <h2>Specificity</h2>
    <p>The probability of a test concluding negative given the actual condition is negative.</p>
    <h2>False Negative Rate (FNR)</h2>
    <p>The probability of a test concluding negative given the actual condition is positive.</p>
    <h2>Sensitivity</h2>
    <p>The probability of a test concluding positive given the actual condition is positive.</p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Home pregnancy test results for 514 women:</p>
    <table border="1">
        <tr><th></th><th>Pregnant</th><th>Not Pregnant</th><th>Totals</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Pregnant</td><td>89</td><td>6</td><td>95</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Not Pregnant</td><td>84</td><td>335</td><td>419</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Totals</td><td>173</td><td>341</td><td>514</td></tr>
    </table>
