                <h1>Density Curves</h1>
                <h2>Continuous Random Variables</h2>
            </header>

            <section>
                <p>A <strong>density curve</strong> is a smooth curve that provides the most common representation of a population's distribution. Statistical software can transform the separate bars of a histogram into this smooth curve, effectively capturing the overall shape of the distribution.</p>
                
                <p>The shape of a density curve is determined using methods similar to those applied to histograms, making it a familiar tool for visualizing data distributions.</p>
                
                <p>Density curves are particularly valuable for determining the <em>proportion</em>, <em>percentage</em>, or <em>probability</em> of a population falling within a specific interval (note that these terms represent the same value). This differs from discrete random variables, where probability is assigned to individual points. In contrast, for a <strong>continuous random variable</strong>, probability is assigned to intervals.</p>
                
                <p>These curves are designed so that the <strong>area under the curve</strong> directly represents the proportion, percentage, or probability of observations, providing a clear visual and mathematical representation of the data.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Properties of a Valid Density Curve</h2>
                <p>To represent a continuous probability distribution accurately, a density curve must satisfy specific properties, much like the requirements for a valid discrete probability distribution:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Continuity:</strong> The curve must be continuous, as it represents a continuous random variable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-negativity:</strong> The curve must never fall below the x-axis, since probability cannot be less than zero.</li>
                    <li><strong>Total Area:</strong> The total area under the curve must equal 1, reflecting that the total probability in any distribution is 1 and cannot exceed it.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="example-section">
                <h2>Example: Understanding a Generic Density Curve</h2>
                <p>Consider a generic density curve representing the distribution of a continuous variable, such as time spent on a task, test scores, or any measurable quantity. Below is an illustration of such a curve:</p>
                
                <figure>
                    <img src="generic-density-curve.png" alt="A smooth, continuous density curve with a shaded area between two points, a and b, above the x-axis, demonstrating probability as area under the curve.">
                    <figcaption>Figure 1: A generic density curve with a shaded area between points \(a\) and \(b\), representing the probability of values falling within that interval.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                
                <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Suppose this curve models a continuous distribution where the x-axis represents the variable (e.g., time in minutes), and the y-axis represents the density. The total area under the curve is 1, satisfying the properties of a density curve.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Application:</strong> To find the probability that the variable falls between two values, say \(a\) and \(b\):</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Identify the interval on the x-axis (from \(a\) to \(b\)).</li>
                    <li>The shaded area under the curve between \(a\) and \(b\) represents the probability of the variable falling within this range.</li>
                    <li>For example, if the shaded area is calculated (using software or integration) to be 0.3, then thereâ€™s a 30% chance the variable lies between \(a\) and \(b\).</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>This generic example highlights how density curves visually and mathematically represent probabilities as areas. Use the calculator on the left to experiment with different intervals or distributions!</p>
